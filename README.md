# 📈 Predicting Social Media Engagement Using DistilBERT

This project presents an end-to-end Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline to predict the **engagement score** of social media posts using a **fine-tuned DistilBERT model**. It uses sentiment polarity and text length to create a meaningful engagement metric, and trains a transformer-based regression model to forecast post performance across different themes.

---

## 🔍 Project Objective

- **Goal**: Predict how engaging a post will be based on its textual content.
- **Why**: Most traditional models rely on surface-level cues (likes, hashtags), ignoring deep semantics.
- **Approach**: Train a transformer model that uses sentiment and verbosity to predict a custom engagement score.

## 🧠 Key Features

- Fine-tuned **DistilBERT** model for regression (fast + low memory).
- Custom **Engagement Score**:
  \[
  \text{Score} = 0.7 \times \text{text\_length\_norm} + 0.3 \times \text{sentiment\_numeric}
  \]
- Engineered features:
  - `text_length_norm`: Min-max normalized word count.
  - `sentiment_numeric`: Scored using TextBlob.
  - `primary_theme`: Balanced label across 6 themes.

## 🧪 Model Performance

| Metric      | Value    |
|-------------|----------|
| R² Score    | 0.7752   |
| RMSE        | 0.0618   |
| Baseline R² | 0.418    |
| RMSE Std Dev (CV) | ±0.007 |

## 💡 Real-World Use Cases

- Rank marketing content before publishing
- Score influencer captions for virality
- Moderate posts based on predicted reach
- Feed into trend-monitoring dashboards

---

## 📉 Limitations

- Does not include user metadata or media (images/hashtags)
- Hyperparameters not exhaustively tuned
- Engagement definition is a proxy—not platform specific
- Sensitive to learning rate and text length variation

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

- Multimodal learning with image/video embeddings
- Hyperparameter tuning (e.g., with Optuna or GridSearch)
- Classification setup (low/med/high engagement)
- Real-time deployment for live content scoring
